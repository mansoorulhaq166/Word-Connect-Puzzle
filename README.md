# Word Puzzle/Connect Game
A word puzzle game built with Jetpack Compose.

## About This Project
This project is a fork of the original [Word Connect Jetpack Compose](https://github.com/farimarwat/word-connect-jetpack-compose) by [Farimarwat](https://github.com/farimarwat). The game structure remains the same, but I have implemented several new features and UI improvements to enhance gameplay.

### New Features & Enhancements:
- **Quick Hint**: Instantly reveal an entire word as a hint.
- **Select Letter Hint**: Players can get a hint for a specific letter.
- **Theme & UI Overhaul**: Revamped design with improved visuals.
- **Discovered Word Meanings**: Players can now view the meanings of words they solve.
- **In-App Purchases (IAPs)**: Added support for purchasing hints and gems.
- **More Improvements Coming Soon!**

### Note:
The project is still in progress, and additional features and refinements are planned.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open it in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
